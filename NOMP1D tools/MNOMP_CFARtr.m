% last refinement date: 2022.12.12
% code is built based on NOMP-CFAR
% SUMMARY:
%   given measurements: y = S * (mixture of sinusoids) + white noise
%          and a parameter tau which relates reduction in residue to
%          sparsity of the explanation (number of sinusoids),
%          this module returns two **ordered** lists: a list of
%          estimates of frequencies of the sinusoids in the mixture
%          and and another list of corresponding gains
% INPUT:
%    y - measurements
%    S - measurement matrix: can be compressive, or
%        just the identity matrix
%    alpha_set - the multiplu factor of CFAR method, which is calculated
%        by $\P_{\rm OE}$ and decided by CFAR method
%    training_cells: number of training cells (N_r)
%    K_max - upper limit of the target number in the scene
%    CFAR_method (optional): method of CFAR, which can be input as
%        'CA' or 'OS'
%              Default value is 'CA'
%    overSamplingRate (optional) -  used to determine how finely
%              we sample frequency grid on which we precompute
%              responses when measurements are compressive (using
%              IFFTs) how fine (in terms of multiples of the FFT
%              grid) do we want the coarse grid to be?
%              number of grid points = overSamplingRate * N
%              Default value is 4
%
%    R_s (optional) : number of Newton steps for a Single frequency update
%                           Default value is 1
%    R_c (optional) : number of rounds of Cyclic Refinement for all of the
%                           already detected sinusoids
%                           Default value is 3
%
% OUTPUT:
%   omegaList    - frequencies
%   gainList     - gains of estimated frequencies
%   residueList - trajectory of the energy in the residual
%                 measurements as we add new sinsoids
%   Threshold_collect - threshold collected with CFAR method
